## Tips for Testing

### 1. Admin vs User Testing
- Use different accounts for admin and user testing
- Admin endpoints require admin role
- Regular user endpoints work with any authenticated user

### 2. Product Management
- Create categories first, then products
- Test stock management features
- Verify featured products functionality

### 3. Shopping Flow
- Test complete shopping flow: Browse ‚Üí Cart ‚Üí Checkout ‚Üí Order
- Verify inventory updates after purchase
- Test order cancellation scenarios

### 4. Error Handling
- Test with invalid product IDs
- Test with insufficient stock
- Test with expired tokens

## Common Issues

### 1. Authentication Errors
- Ensure `access_token` is set in environment
- Check if token has expired
- Verify Authorization header format

### 2. Product Management
- Ensure category exists before creating products
- Check required fields (price, stock, etc.)
- Verify image URLs are accessible

### 3. Inventory Issues
- Check stock quantity before purchase
- Verify stock updates after orders
- Test out-of-stock scenarios
